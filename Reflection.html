<p align="center" style="font-size:23;">I learned that coding is an important thing in making websites as it is what makes it possible to exist. Without the help of HTML, we wouldn't be able to use the internet as it is today. Even if other programming languages exist, we still need HTML as the basis. Some things that can be created with the help of HTML are <strong>lists, tables and forms</strong>. These have different purposes depending on what the author or programmer wants to make. A <strong>list</strong> can help us <u>organize</u> to do lists, grocery lists and information. There are 3 types that serve their own purpose. These are the ordered, unordered and definition lists. These are useful in everyday life because it can help us in <u>keeping track of things or can help others understand the information easier</u> as it provides an outline. <strong>Tables</strong> are a type of graphics used to </u>organize collected data into rows and columns</u>. Tables can help with <u>research studying and also keeping track of information</u>. Another use of tables is its ability to be used for <u>presenting data</u>. Because it gives an easy way for viewers to understand data, it can be used in many situations. It is also very customizable and can be adjusted to your preference. Last is <strong>HTML Forms</strong>. Just like Google forms, it is used to </u>collect feedback from viewers to know more about the audience and what part of the website or service you are providing needs improvement on</u>. It can also help in knowing the <u>satisfactory rate of the general audience on your service</u>. All of these introduces us into the world of coding, the many different languages that make the world wide web what it is now. From this we learn how to make games and apps. Even if HTML is not that advanced, it still teaches us how to create a basic functional website with many different elements. HTML is important for us to learn as we shift towards a more advcanced and technological future.</b></p>
