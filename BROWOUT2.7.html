            <p> As you can see, we were able to position the images in the way we wanted and likewise for the text when we use the margin and padding properties. For the background, since the value is repeat-x, it will only repeat along the x-axis no matter how far you zoom out.</p>
            <p>The box model is a concept we can use to understand how the space between elements work. We can also contorl these with the help of CSS. The height, width, margin, padding, etc are collectivley known as the dimensions of an element. We can also set the position of an element with the help of the position property. Float property can be used to indicate where the next elements can be displayed while the background-repeat of an element can also be controlled. An example of another dimension we can control is the margin properties which as the property states, controlls the margin of an element.</p>
